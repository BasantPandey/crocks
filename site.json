All you need to do is run the following to save it as a dependency in your current project folder: $ npm install crocks -S This will pull down crocks into your project's node_modules folder and can be accessed by adding something like the following in the file that needs it: // node require syntax const crocks = require('crocks') // Javascript modules (if you are transpiling) import crocks from 'crocks' Import only what you need This lib should work, with no additional compilation in all current browsers (Edge, Safari, Chrome, Firefox), if it does not, please file an issue as I really, really want it to. There is a lot to this library, and as such it may not be desired to bring in the entire library when bundling for a library or a frontend application. If this is the case, the code is organized in a manner groups all types in functions that construct those type in their own folders. The general purpose functions are spread across the following folders: combinators, helpers, logic, pointfree and predicates. To access the types, just reference the folder like: crocks/Maybe, or crocks/Result. If you want to access a function that constructs a given type, reference it by name, like: crocks/Maybe/safe or crocks/Result/tryCatch. This organization helps ensure that you only include what you need. Another thing to note is, if you are transpiling, then destructuring in your import statement is not going to work as you are thinking (maybe if you are using babel, but this will be broken once modules are available in node, so be careful). Basically you should not do this, as crocks will not be set up for it until modules are available in node: // Nope! Nope! Nope!: import { Maybe, compose, curry, map } from 'crocks' // instead do something like this: import crocks from 'crocks' const { Maybe, compose, curry, map } = crocks // do not wanna bring all of crocks into your bundle? // I feel ya, all try this: import Maybe from 'crocks/Maybe' import compose from 'crock/helpers/compose' import curry from 'crocks/helpers/curry' import map from 'crocks/pointfree/map' // you can of course do the same with require statements: const All = require('crocks/All') ...

Arrow can be considered a Strong Profunctor if the underlying data running throw the Arrow is a Pair, typically in the form of Arrow (Pair a c) (Pair b d). This will allow you to split execution into two distinct paths, applying Arrow to a specific path. The parameters of Arrow represent the function that it wraps, with the input being on the left, and the output on the right.

This allows the interface of a Reader that enables the composition of computations that depend on a shared environment (e - a), but provides a way to abstract a means the Reader portion, when combining ReaderTs of the same type. All ReaderTs must provide the constructor of the target Monad that is being wrapped.

This can be used to lift a pointed instance of the underlying Monad. When mixed with composition, lift can be used to promote functions that take the form of a - m b into a function that can be chained with the ReaderT.

The resultant portion may vary it's type, but the state portion must be fixed to a type that is used by all related stateful computations. All State instances wrap a function of the form s - Pair a s and can be constructed by providing a function of this form. In order to get maximum reuse of existing functions, a few construction helpers are available on the State constructor. State is lazy and is required to be run at the edge with some initial state. Three methods are available on the instance for running the State with a given initial state. runWith will return a Pair a s with the state s on the right and the resultant a on the left. The other two are used for extracting either the state or resultant, unwrapping the values from the Pair and discarding the unwanted portion. evalWith used when the resultant is wanted, while execWith is used to pull the state. const State = require('crocks/State') const { get, put } = State const Pair = require('crocks/Pair') const constant = require('crocks/combinators/constant') // toUpper :: String - String const toUpper = x = x.toUpperCase() // putResultant :: String - State String String const putResultant = x = put(x) .map(constant(x)) // standard construction // State String String State(s = Pair(toUpper(s), s)) .runWith('nice') //= Pair('NICE', 'nice') // construction helper // State String String get(toUpper) .runWith('nice') //= Pair('NICE', 'nice') // combine states get(toUpper) .chain(putResultant) .runWith('nice') //= Pair('NICE', 'NICE') // pull resultant only get(toUpper) .evalWith('nice') //= 'NICE' // pull state only get(toUpper) .execWith('nice') //= 'nice' Implements Functor, Apply, Chain, Applicative, Monad Constructor Methods get State.get :: () - State s s State.get :: (s - a) - State s a A construction helper that is used to access the state portion of a given State instance. To make the state accessible, get will place the state in the resultant portion, overwriting what was there previously. get may be called with or without a function as it's argument.

The lifted function will receive the state and returns a new State instance with the result of the function in the state portion.

If the previous value is required for a given stateful computation, modify can be used to lift a function that represents the change. As put updates the state, it is important to ensure that the state portion stays fixed for all related functions. Changing the type of the state portion may result in hard to debug bugs and destroys the relationship between stateful computations. const { put } = require('crocks/State') const compose = require('crocks/helpers/compose') const isString = require('crocks/predicates/isString') const option = require('crocks/pointfree/option') const safe = require('crocks/Maybe/safe') // safeString :: a - String const safeString = compose(option(''), safe(isString)) // reset :: () - State String () const reset = () = put('') // update :: a - State String () const update = compose(put, safeString) // heckYeah :: State String () const heckYeah = update('Oh Heck Yeah') heckYeah .execWith('Gosh') //= 'Oh Heck Yeah' heckYeah .chain(reset) .runWith('Gosh') // Pair((), '') of State.of :: a - State s a Used to \"blindly\" lift any Javascript value into a State, of will take the provided value and return back a new State instance with the value in the resultant.

This allows complex stateful computations to be represented with State. The map method provides a means to lift a function into the datatype that will be applied to the resultant and return a new instance of State with the result of the function as the new resultant. While this is similar to the modify construction helper, which lifts an endo-function that acts upon the state, map does not require an endo-function as it can move to any type. Due to the composition law associated with map, successive maps can be composed together using function composition. This will give the same results but will only map the value once, instead of once for every mapping. const { get } = require('crocks/State') const compose = require('crocks/helpers/compose') const objOf = require('crocks/helpers/objOf') const propOr = require('crocks/helpers/propOr') // add :: Number - Number - Number const add = x = y = x + y // getNum :: State Object Number const getNum = get(propOr(0, 'num')) getNum .map(add(10)) .evalWith({ num: 32 }) //= 42 getNum .map(add(10)) .map(objOf('result')) .evalWith({ val: 32 }) //= { result: 10 } // comp :: Number - Object const comp = compose( objOf('result'), add(10) ) getNum .map(comp) .evalWith({ num: 32 }) //= { result: 42 } ap State s (a - b) ~ State s a - State s b Short for apply, the ap method is used to apply the resultant of a given State instance to a function wrapped in another instance. On a State instance that wraps a function, calling ap, providing it another State instance, will return a new State instance with the result of the function in the resultant portion.

A given State instance provides an execWith method that accepts a value to run the instance with. The value must be a member of the type that the given State instance is fixed to in it's state portion, s. When called, execWith will run the state transition with the given value as the initial state and will return the resulting state, discarding the resultant portion. const { modify } = require('crocks/State') const compose = require('crocks/helpers/compose') const concat = require('crocks/pointfree/concat') // toUpper :: String - String const toUpper = x = x.toUpperCase() // exclaim :: String - String const exclaim = concat('!!!') // yell :: State String () const yell = modify( compose(exclaim, toUpper) ) yell .execWith('nice') //= 'NICE!!!' Pointfree Functions evalWith (pointfree) evalWith :: s - State s a - a The evalWith pointfree function can be employed to execute the evalWith method on a given State instance. This function is typically used at the edge of a program where all the side-effects typically reside. As all this function does is return the result of applying a given initial state to the evalWith method to the provided State instance, it will also return the resulting resultant, throwing away the resulting state. const { get } = require('crocks/State') const evalWith = require('crocks/State/evalWith') const compose = require('crocks/helpers/compose') const curry = require('crocks/helpers/curry') const flip = require('crocks/combinators/flip') // addToState :: Number - State Number Number const addToState = x = get(y = x + y) // add :: Number - Number - Number const add = curry( compose(flip(evalWith), addToState) ) // add10 :: Number - Number const add10 = add(10) add10(32) //= 42 add(1295, 42) // 1337 execWith (pointfree) execWith :: s - State s a - s The execWith pointfree function can be employed to execute the execWith method on a given State instance.

This is where you will find all your favorite ADT's you have grown to love. They include gems such as: Maybe, Either and IO, to name a few. The are usually just a simple constructor that takes either a function or value (depending on the type) and will return you a \"container\" that wraps whatever you passed it. Each container provides a variety of functions that act as the operations you can do on the contained value. There are many types that share the same function names, but what they do from type to type may vary. Every Crock provides type function on the Constructor and both inspect and type functions on their Instances. All Crocks are Constructor functions of the given type, with Writer being an exception. The Writer function takes a Monoid that will represent the log. Once you provide the Monoid, the function will return the Writer Constructor for your Writer using that specific Monoid. | Crock | Constructor | Instance | |---|:---|:---| | Arrow | id | both, compose, contramap, empty, first, map, promap, runWith, second | | Async | Rejected, Resolved, all, fromNode, fromPromise, of | alt, ap, bimap, chain, coalesce, fork, map, of, swap, toPromise | | Const | -- | ap, chain, concat, equals, map, valueOf | | Either | Left, Right, of| alt, ap, bimap, chain, coalesce, concat, either, equals, map, of, sequence, swap, traverse | | Identity | of | ap, chain, concat, equals, map, of, sequence, traverse, valueOf | | IO | of | ap, chain, map, of, run | | List | empty, fromArray, of | ap, chain, concat, cons, empty, equals, filter, head, map, of, reduce, reject, sequence, tail, toArray, traverse, valueOf | | Maybe | Nothing, Just, of, zero | alt, ap, chain, coalesce, concat, equals, either, map, of, option, sequence, traverse, zero | | Pair | --- | ap, bimap, chain, concat, equals, extend, fst, map, merge, of, snd, swap, toArray | | Pred * | empty | concat, contramap, empty, runWith, valueOf | | Reader | ask, of| ap, chain, map, of, runWith | | Result | Err, Ok, of| alt, ap, bimap, chain, coalesce, concat, either, equals, map, of, sequence, swap, traverse | | Star | id | both, compose, contramap, map, promap, runWith | | State | get, modify of, put| ap, chain, evalWith, execWith, map, of, runWith | | Unit | empty, of | ap, chain, concat, empty, equals, map, of, valueOf | | Writer| of | ap, chain, equals, log, map, of, read, valueOf | \\* based on this article ","srcFilePath":"src/pages/docs/crocks/index.md","id":"crocks","location":"/docs/crocks/","url":"/crocks/docs/crocks/","childIds":["Arrow","Equiv","Pred","Reader","State"]},"functions":{"children":{"combinators":{"description":"Combinators API","layout":"notopic","title":"Combinators","weight":1,"content":" applyTo crocks/combinators/applyTo applyTo :: (a - b) - a - b Seems really silly, but is quite useful for a lot of things. It takes a function and a value and then returns the result of that function with the argument applied. composeB crocks/combinators/composeB composeB :: (b - c) - (a - b) - a - c Provides a means to describe a composition between two functions. it takes two functions and a value. Given composeB(f, g), which is read f after g, it will return a function that will take value a and apply it to g, passing the result as an argument to f, and will finally return the result of f. (This allows only two functions, if you want to avoid things like: composeB(composeB(f, g), composeB(h, i)) then check out compose.) constant crocks/combinators/constant constant :: a - _ - a This is a very handy dandy function, used a lot. Pass it any value and it will give you back a function that will return that same value no matter what you pass it. flip crocks/combinators/flip flip :: (a - b - c) - b - a - c This little function just takes a function and returns a function that takes the first two parameters in reverse. One can compose flip calls down the line to flip all, or some of the other parameters if there are more than two. Mix and match to your heart's desire. identity crocks/combinators/identity identity :: a - a This function and constant are the workhorses of writing code with this library. It quite simply is just a function that when you pass it something, it returns that thing right back to you. So simple, I will leave it as an exercise to reason about why this is so powerful and important. reverseApply crocks/combinators/reverseApply reverseApply :: a - (a - b) - b Ever run into a situation where you have a value but do not have a function to apply it to? Well this little bird, named Thrush, is there to help out. Just give it a value and it will give you back a function ready to take a function. Once that function is provided, it will return the result of applying your value to that function. substitution crocks/combinators/substitution substitution :: (a - b - c) - (a - b) - a - c While it a complicated little bugger, it can come in very handy from time to time. In it's first two arguments it takes functions. The first must be binary and the second unary. That will return you a function that is ready to take some value. Once supplied the fun starts, it will pass the a to the first argument of both functions, and the result of the second function to the second parameter of the first function. Finally after all that juggling, it will return the result of that first function. When used with partial application on that first parameter, a whole new world of combinatory madness is presented!

This can be accomplished in crocks by reaching for assign. Unlike the Object.assign that ships with JavaScript, this assign will combine your Objects into a new shallow copy of their merger. assign only takes two arguments and will overwrite keys present in the second argument with values from the first. As with most of the crocks Object based functions, assign will omit any key-value pairs that are undefined. Check out a related function named defaultProps that will only assign values that are undefined in the second argument. assoc crocks/helpers/assoc assoc :: String - a - Object - Object There may come a time when you want to add a key-value pair to an Object and want control over how the key and value are applied. That is where assoc can come to your aid. Just provide a String key and a value of any type to be associated to the key. Finally pass it any Object and you will get back a shallow copy with your key-value pair merged in. This will overwrite any exiting keys with new value specified. Used with flip, you can do some interesting things with this function, give it a play! If you just want to create an Object and not concatenate it to another Object, objOf may be the function for you. binary crocks/helpers/binary binary :: (* - c) - a - b - c With all the different functions out there in the real world, sometimes it is nice to restrict them to a specific -arity to work with your all your wonderful compositions. When you want to restict any function of any arity to a simple binary function. Just pass your function to binary and you will get back a curried, binary function that will only apply (2) arguments to the inner function, ignoring any others. This works very well with functions like Array.prototype.reduce where you may only care about the first 2 arguments. if you need to constrain to more than (2) arguments, then you will want to reach for nAry. binary is basically syntactic sugar for nAry(2, fn). Also related is unary, which constrains to (1) argument. branch crocks/Pair/branch branch :: a - Pair a a When you want to branch a computation into two parts, this is the function you want to reach for. All it does is let you pass in any a and will return you a Pair that has your value on both the first and second parameter. This allows you to work on the value in two separate computation paths. Be advised that this is Javascript and if a is an object type (Object, Array, Date, etc) they will reference each other. Pro-Tip: Pair provides a merge function that will let you fold the two values into a single value. compose crocks/helpers/compose compose :: ((y - z), (x - y), ..., (a - b)) - a - z While the composeB can be used to create a composition of two functions, there are times when you want to compose an entire flow together. That is where compose is useful. With compose you can create a right-to-left composition of functions. It will return you a function that represents your flow. Not really sold on writing flows from right-to-left? Well then, I would recommend reaching for pipe. composeK crocks/helpers/composeK composeK :: Chain m = ((y - m z), (x - m y), ..., (a - m b)) - a - m z There are many times that, when working with the various crocks, our flows are just a series of chains. Due to some neat properties with types that provide a chain function, you can remove some boilerplate by reaching for composeK. Just pass it the functions you would normally pass to chain and it will do all the boring hook up for you. Just like compose, functions are applied right-to-left, so you can turn this: const { chain, compose, isObject, prop, safe } = crocks const data = { do: { re: { mi: 'fa' } } } // fluent :: a - Maybe b const fluent = x = safe(isObject, x) .chain(prop('do')) .chain(prop('re')) .chain(prop('mi')) fluent(data) // = Just 'fa' // pointfree :: a - Maybe b const pointfree = compose( chain(prop('mi')), chain(prop('re')), chain(prop('do')), safe(isObject) ) pointfree(data) // = Just 'fa' into the more abbreviated form: const { composeK, isObject, prop, safe } = crocks const data = { do: { re: { mi: 'fa' } } } // flow :: a - Maybe b const flow = composeK( prop('mi'), prop('re'), prop('do'), safe(isObject) ) flow(data) // = Just 'fa' As demonstrated in the above example, this function more closely resembles flows that are using a more pointfree style of coding. As with the other composition functions in crocks, a pipeK function is provided for flows that make more sense expressed in a left-to-right style. composeP crocks/helpers/composeP composeP :: Promise p = ((y - p z c), (x - p y c), ..., (a - p b c)) - a - p z c When working with Promises, it is common place to create chains on a Promise's then function: const promFunc = x = promiseSomething(x) .then(doSomething) .then(doAnother) Doing this involves a lot of boilerplate and forces you into a fluent style, whether you want to be or not. Using composeP you have the option to compose a series of Promise returning functions like you would any other function composition, in a right-to-left fashion. Like so: const { composeP } = crocks const promFunc = composeP(doAnother, doSomething, promiseSomething) Due to the nature of the then function, only the head of your composition needs to return a Promise. This will create a function that takes a value, which is passed through your chain, returning a Promise which can be extended. This is only a then chain, it does not do anything with the catch function. If you would like to provide your functions in a left-to-right manner, check out pipeP. composeS crocks/helpers/composeS composeS :: Semigroupoid s = (s y z, s x y, ..., s a b) - s a z When working with things like Arrow and Star there will come a point when you would like to compose them like you would any Function. That is where composeS comes in handy. Just pass it the Semigroupoids you want to compose and it will give you back a new Semigroupoid of the same type with all of the underlying functions composed and ready to be run. Like compose, composeS composes the functions in a right-to-left fashion. If you would like to represent your flow in a more left-to-right manner, then pipeS is provided for such things. const { Arrow, bimap, branch, composeS, merge, mreduce, Sum } = require('crocks') const length = xs = xs.length const divide = (x, y) = x / y const avg = Arrow(bimap(mreduce(Sum), length)) .promap(branch, merge(divide)) const double = Arrow(x = x * 2) const data = [ 34, 198, 3, 43, 92 ] composeS(double, avg) .runWith(data) // = 148 curry crocks/helpers/curry curry :: ((a, b, ...) - z) - a - b - ... - z Pass this function a function and it will return you a function that can be called in any form that you require until all arguments have been provided. For example if you pass a function: f : (a, b, c) - d you get back a function that can be called in any combination, such as: f(x, y, z), f(x)(y)(z), f(x, y)(z), or even f(x)(y, z). This is great for doing partial application on functions for maximum re-usability. defaultProps crocks/helpers/defaultProps defaultProps :: Object - Object - Object Picture this, you have an Object and you want to make sure that some properties are set with a given default value. When the need for this type of operation presents itself, defaultProps can come to your aid. Just pass it an Object that defines your defaults and then the Object your want to default those props on. If a key that is present on the defaults Object is not defined on your data, then the default value will be used. Otherwise, the value from your data will be used instead. You could just apply flip to the assign function and get the same result, but having a function named defaultProps may be easier to read in code. As with most Object related functions in crocks, defaultProps will return you a shallow copy of the result and not include any undefined values in either Object. defaultTo crocks/helpers/defaultTo defaultTo :: a - b - a With things like null, undefined and NaN showing up all over the place, it can be hard to keep your expected types inline without resorting to nesting in a Maybe with functions like safe. If you want to specifically guard for null, undefined and NaN and get things defaulted into the expected type, then defaultTo should work for you. Just pass it what you would like your default value to be and then the value you want guarded, and you will get back either the default or the passed value, depending on if the passed value is null, undefined or NaN. While this is JavaScript and you can return anything, it is suggested to stick to the signature and only let as through. As a b can be an a as well. dissoc crocks/helpers/dissoc dissoc :: String - Object - Object While assoc can be used to associate a given key-value pair to a given Object, dissoc does the opposite. Just pass dissoc a String key and the Object you wish to dissociate that key from and you will get back a new, shallow copy of the Object sans your key. As with all the Object functions, dissoc will remove any undefined values from the result. fanout crocks/helpers/fanout fanout :: (a - b) - (a - c) - (a - Pair b c) fanout :: Arrow a b - Arrow a c - Arrow a (Pair b c) fanout :: Monad m = Star a (m b) - Star a (m c) - Star a (m (Pair b c)) There are may times that you need to keep some running or persistent state while performing a given computation. A common way to do this is to take the input to the computation and branch it into a Pair and perform different operations on each version of the input. This is such a common pattern that it warrants the fanout function to take care of the initial split and mapping. Just provide a pair of either simple functions or a pair of one of the computation types (Arrow or Star). You will get back something of the same type that is configured to split it's input into a pair and than apply the first Function/ADT to the first portion of the underlying Pair and the second on the second. fromPairs crocks/helpers/fromPairs fromPairs :: [ (Pair String a) ] | List (Pair String a) - Object As an inverse to toPairs, fromPairs takes either an Array or List of key-value Pairs and constructs an Object from it. The Pair must contain a String in the fst and any type of value in the snd. The fst will become the key for the value in the snd. All primitive values are copied into the new Object, while non-primitives are references to the original. If you provide an undefined values for the second, that Pair will not be represented in the resulting Object. Also, when if multiple keys share the same name, that last value will be moved over. liftA2 crocks/helpers/liftA2 liftA2 :: Applicative m = (a - b - c) - m a - m b - m c liftA3 crocks/helpers/liftA3 liftA3 :: Applicative m = (a - b - c - d) - m a - m b - m c - m d Ever see yourself wanting to map a binary or trinary function, but map only allows unary functions? Both of these functions allow you to pass in your function as well as the number of Applicatives (containers that provide both of and ap functions) you need to get the mapping you are looking for. mapProps crocks/helpers/mapProps mapProps :: { (* - *) } - Object - Object Would like to map specific keys in an Object with a specific function? Just bring in mapProps and pass it an Object with the functions you want to apply on the keys you want them associated to. When the resulting function receives an Object, it will return a new Object with the keys mapped according to the mapping functions. All keys from the original Object that do not exist in the mapping Object will still exist untouched, but the keys with mapping functions with now contain the result of applying the original value to the provided mapping function. mapProps also allows for mapping on nested Objects for times when the shape of the original Object is know. const mapProps = require('crocks/helpers/mapProps') const add = x = y = x + y const toUpper = x = x.toUpperCase() const mapping = { entry: toUpper, fauna: { unicorns: add(1), elephants: add(-1) }, flora: { nariphon: add(10), birch: add(1) } } mapProps(mapping, { entry: 'legend', fauna: { unicorns: 10, zombies: 3 }, other: { hat: 2 } }) //= { entry: 'LEGEND', fauna: { unicorns: 11, zombies: 3 }, other: { hat: 2} } mapReduce crocks/helpers/mapReduce mapReduce :: Foldable f = (a - b) - (c - b - c) - c - f a Sometimes you need the power provided by mreduceMap but you do not have a Monoid to lift into. mapReduce provides the same power, but with the flexibility of using functions to lift and combine. mapReduce takes a unary mapping function, a binary reduction function, the initial value and finally a Foldable structure of data. Once all arguments are provided, mapReduce folds the provided data, by mapping each value through your mapping function, before sending it to the second argument of your reduction function. const Max = require('crocks/Max') const { Nothing } = require('crocks/Maybe') const isNumber = require('crocks/predicates/isNumber') const mapReduce = require('crocks/helpers/mapReduce') const safeLift = require('crocks/Maybe/safeLift') const data = [ '100', null, 3, true, 1 ] const safeMax = mapReduce( safeLift(isNumber, Max), (y, x) = y.concat(x).alt(y).alt(x), Nothing() ) safeMax(data) .option(Max.empty()) .valueOf() // = 3 mconcat crocks/helpers/mconcat mconcat :: Monoid m = m - ([ a ] | List a) - m a mreduce crocks/helpers/mreduce mreduce :: Monoid m = m - ([ a ] | List a) - a These two functions are very handy for combining an entire List or Array of values by providing a Monoid and your collection of values. The difference between the two is that mconcat returns the result inside the Monoid used to combine them. Where mreduce returns the bare value itself. mconcatMap crocks/helpers/mconcatMap mconcatMap :: Monoid m = m - (b - a) - ([ b ] | List b) - m a mreduceMap crocks/helpers/mreduceMap mreduceMap :: Monoid m = m - (b - a) - ([ b ] | List b) - a There comes a time where the values you have in a List or an Array are not in the type that is needed for the Monoid you want to combine with. These two functions can be used to map some transforming function from a given type into the type needed for the Monoid. In essence, this function will run each value through the function before it lifts the value into the Monoid, before concat is applied. The difference between the two is that mconcatMap returns the result inside the Monoid used to combine them. Where mreduceMap returns the bare value itself. nAry crocks/helpers/nAry nAry :: Number - (* - a) - * - * - a When using functions like Math.max or Object.assign that take as many arguments as you can throw at them, it makes it hard to curry them in a reasonable manner. nAry can make things a little nicer for functions like that. It can also be put to good use to limit a given function to a desired number of arguments to avoid accidentally supplying default arguments when you do not what them applied. First pass nAry the number of arguments you wish to limit the function to and then the function you wish to limit. nAry will give you back a curried function that will only apply the specified number of arguments to the inner function. Unary and binary functions are so common that crocks provides specific functions for those cases: unary and binary. objOf crocks/helpers/objOf objOf :: String - a - Object If you ever find yourself in a situation where you have a key and a value and just want to combine the two into an Object, then it sounds like objOf is the function for you. Just pass it a String for the key and any type of value, and you'll get back an Object that is composed of those two. If you find yourself constantly concatenating the result of this function into another Object, you may want to use assoc instead. omit crocks/helpers/omit omit :: ([ String ] | List String) - Object - Object Sometimes you just want to strip Objects of unwanted properties by key. Using omit will help you get that done. Just pass it a Foldable structure with a series of Strings as keys and then pass it an Object and you will get back not only a shallow copy, but also an Object free of any of those pesky undefined values. You can think of omit as a way to black-list or reject Object properties based on key names. This function ignores inherited properties and should only be used with POJOs. If you want to filter or white-list properties rather than reject them, take a look at pick. once crocks/helpers/once once :: (() - a) - (() - a) There are times in Javascript development where you only want to call a function once and memo-ize the first result for every subsequent call to that function. Just pass the function you want guarded to once and you will get back a function with the expected guarantees. partial crocks/helpers/partial partial :: ((* - c), *) - * - c There are many times when using functions from non-functional libraries or from built-in JS functions, where it does not make sense to wrap it in a curry. You just want to partially apply some arguments to it and get back a function ready to take the rest. That is a perfect opportunity to use partial. Just pass a function as the first argument and then apply any other arguments to it. You will get back a curried function that is ready to accept the rest of the arguments. const { map, partial } = require('crocks') const max10 = partial(Math.min, 10) const data = [ 13, 5, 13 ] map(max10, data) // = [ 10, 5, 10] pick crocks/helpers/pick pick :: ([ String ] | List String) - Object - Object When dealing with Objects, sometimes it is necessary to only let some of the key-value pairs on an object through. Think of pick as a sort of white-list or filter for Object properties. Pass it a Foldable structure of Strings that are the keys you would like to pick off of your Object. This will give you back a shallow copy of the key-value pairs you specified. This function will ignore inherited properties and should only be used with POJOs. Any undefined values will not be copied over, although null values are allowed. For black-listing properties, have a look at omit. pipe crocks/helpers/pipe pipe :: ((a - b), (b - c), ..., (y - z)) - a - z If you find yourself not able to come to terms with doing the typical right-to-left composition, then crocks provides a means to accommodate you. This function does the same thing as compose, the only difference is it allows you define your flows in a left-to-right manner. pipeK crocks/helpers/pipeK pipeK :: Chain m = ((a - m b), (b - m c), ..., (y - m z)) - a - m z Like composeK, you can remove much of the boilerplate when chaining together a series of functions with the signature: Chain m = a - m b. The difference between the two functions is, while composeK is right-to-left, pipeK is the opposite, taking its functions left-to-right. const { curry, List, Writer } = require('../crocks') const OpWriter = Writer(List) const addLog = curry( (x, y) = OpWriter(adding ${x} to ${y}, x + y) ) const scaleLog = curry( (x, y) = OpWriter(scaling ${y} by ${x}, x * y) ) const fluent = x = OpWriter.of(x) .chain(addLog(4)) .chain(scaleLog(3)) fluent(0).log() // = List [ \"adding 4 to 0\", \"scaling 4 by 3\" ] const chainPipe = pipeK( addLog(4), scaleLog(3) ) chainPipe(0).log() // = List [ \"adding 4 to 0\", \"scaling 4 by 3\" ] pipeP crocks/helpers/pipeP pipeP :: Promise p = ((a - p b d), (b - p c d), ..., (y - p z d)) - a - p z d Like the composeP function, pipeP will let you remove the standard boilerplate that comes with working with Promise chains. The only difference between pipeP and composeP is that it takes its functions in a left-to-right order: const { pipeP } = crocks const promFunc = x = promise(x) .then(doSomething) .then(doAnother) const promPipe = pipeP(proimse, doSomething, doAnother) pipeS crocks/helpers/pipeS pipeS :: Semigroupoid s = (s a b, s b c, ..., s y z) - s a z While Stars and Arrows come in very handy at times, the only thing that could make them better is to compose them . With pipeS you can do just that with any Semigroupoid. Just like with composeS, you just pass it Semigroupoids of the same type and you will get back another Semigroupoid with them all composed together. The only difference between the two, is that pipeS composes in a left-to-right fashion, while composeS does the opposite. const { curry, isNumber, pipeS, prop, safeLift, Star } = require('../crocks') const add = curry( (x, y) = x + y ) const pull = x = Star(prop(x)) const safeAdd = x = Star(safeLift(isNumber, add(x))) const data = { num: 56, string: '56' } const flow = (key, num) = pipeS( pull(key), safeAdd(num) ) flow('num', 10).runWith(data) // = Just 66 flow('string', 100).runWith(data) // = Nothing prop crocks/Maybe/prop prop :: (String | Integer) - a - Maybe b If you want some safety around pulling a value out of an Object or Array with a single key or index, you can always reach for prop. Well, as long as you are working with non-nested data that is. Just tell prop either the key or index you are interested in, and you will get back a function that will take anything and return a Just with the wrapped value if the key/index exists. If the key/index does not exist however, you will get back a Nothing. propOr crocks/helpers/propOr propOr :: a - (String | Integer) - b - c If you want some safety around pulling a value out of an Object or Array with a single key or index, you can always reach for propOr. Well, as long as you are working with non-nested data that is. Just tell propOr either the key or index you are interested in, and you will get back a function that will take anything and return the wrapped value if the key/index exists. If the key/index does not exist however, you will get back a default value. const { get } = require('crocks/State') const propOr = require('crocks/helpers/propOr') const data = { foo: 'bar' } get() .map(propOr('default', 'foo')) .evalWith(data) // bar get() .map(propOr('default', 'baz')) .evalWith(data) // default propPath crocks/Maybe/propPath propPath :: [ String | Integer ] - a - Maybe b While prop is good for simple, single-level structures, there may come a time when you have to work with nested POJOs or Arrays. When you run into this situation, just pull in propPath and pass it a left-to-right traversal path of keys, indices or a combination of both (gross...but possible). This will kick you back a function that behaves just like prop. You pass it some data, and it will attempt to resolve your provided path. If the path is valid, it will return the value residing there (null included!) in a Just. But if at any point that path \"breaks\" it will give you back a Nothing. propPathOr crocks/helpers/propPathOr propPathOr :: a - [ String | Integer ] - b - c While propOr is good for simple, single-level structures, there may come a time when you have to work with nested POJOs or Arrays. When you run into this situation, just pull in propPathOr and pass it a left-to-right traversal path of keys, indices or a combination of both (gross...but possible). This will kick you back a function that behaves just like propOr. You pass it some data, and it will attempt to resolve your provided path. If the path is valid, it will return the value. But if at any point that path \"breaks\" it will give you back the default value. const { get } = require('crocks/State') const propPathOr = require('crocks/helpers/propPathOr') const data = { foo: { bar: 'bar' }, baz: null } get() .map(propPathOr('default', ['foo', 'bar'])) .evalWith(data) // bar get() .map(propPathOr('default', ['baz', 'tommy'])) .evalWith(data) // default safe crocks/Maybe/safe safe :: ((a - Boolean) | Pred) - a - Maybe a When using a Maybe, it is a common practice to lift into a Just or a Nothing depending on a condition on the value to be lifted. It is so common that it warrants a function, and that function is called safe. Provide a predicate (a function that returns a Boolean) and a value to be lifted. The value will be evaluated against the predicate, and will lift it into a Just if true and a Nothing if false. safeLift crocks/Maybe/safeLift safeLift :: ((a - Boolean) | Pred) - (a - b) - a - Maybe b While safe is used to lift a value into a Maybe, you can reach for safeLift when you want to run a function in the safety of the Maybe context. Just like safe, you pass it either a Pred or a predicate function to determine if you get a Just or a Nothing, but then instead of a value, you pass it a unary function. safeLift will then give you back a new function that will first lift its argument into a Maybe and then maps your original function over the result. tap crocks/helpers/tap tap :: (a - b) - a - a It is hard knowing what is going on inside of some of these ADTs or your wonderful function compositions. Debugging can get messy when you need to insert a side-effect into your flow for introspection purposes. With tap, you can intervene in your otherwise pristine flow and make sure that the original value is passed along to the next step of your flow. This function does not guarantee immutability for reference types (Objects, Arrays, etc), you will need to exercise some discipline here to not mutate. toPairs crocks/Pair/toPairs toPairs :: Object - List (Pair String a) When dealing with Objects, sometimes it makes more sense to work in a Foldable structure like a List of key-value Pairs. toPairs provides a means to take an object and give you back a List of Pairs that have a String that represents the key in the fst and the value for that key in the snd. The primitive values are copied, while non-primitive values are references. Like most of the Object functions in crocks, any keys with undefined values will be omitted from the result. crocks provides an inverse to this function named fromPairs. tryCatch crocks/Result/tryCatch tryCatch :: (a - b) - a - Result e b Typical try-catch blocks are very imperative in their usage. This tryCatch function provides a means of capturing that imperative nature in a simple declarative style. Pass it a function that could fail and it will return you another function wrapping the first function. When called, the new function will either return the result in a Result.Ok if everything was good, or an error wrapped in an Result.Err if it fails. unary crocks/helpers/unary unary :: (* - b) - a - b If you every need to lock down a given function to just one argument, then look no further than unary. Just pass it a function of any arity, and you will get back another function that will only apply (1) argument to given function, no matter what is passed to it. unary is just syntactic sugar around nAry in the form of nAry(1, fn) as it is such a common case. Another common case is binary which, as the name implies, only applies (2) arguments to a given function. unit crocks/helpers/unit unit :: () - undefined While it seems like just a simple function, unit can be used for a number of things. A common use for it is as a default noop as it is a function that does nothing and returns undefined. You can also use it in a pointed fashion to represent some special value for a given type. This pointed use is the heart and soul of the infamous Maybe type.

This function take a predicate (some function that returns a Boolean) and two functions. The first is what is executed when the predicate is true, the second on a false condition. This will return a function ready to take a value to run through the predicate. After the value is evaluated, it will be ran through it's corresponding function, returning the result as the final result. This function comes in really handy when creating lifting functions for Sum Types (like Either or Maybe). not not :: ((a - Boolean) | Pred) - a - Boolean When you need to negate a predicate function or a Pred, but want a new predicate function that does the negation, then not is going to get you what you need. Using not will allow you to stay as declarative as possible. Just pass not your predicate function or a Pred, and it will give you back a predicate function ready for insertion into your flow. All predicate based functions in crocks take either a Pred or predicate function, so it should be easy to swap between the two. or or :: ((a - Boolean) | Pred) - ((a - Boolean) | Pred) - a - Boolean Say you have two predicate functions or Preds and would like to combine them into one predicate over disjunction, look no further, or accepts either predicate functions or Preds and will return you a function ready to take a value.

Take for example the following structure: const data = Either.of(Maybe.of(3)) // Right Just 3 // mapping on the inner Maybe is tedious at best data .map(map(x = x + 1)) // Right Just 4 .map(map(x = x * 10)) // Right Just 40 // and extraction...super gross data .either(identity, identity) // Just 3 .option(0) // 3 // or data .either(option(0), option(0)) // 3 The transformation functions, that ship with crocks, provide a means for dealing with this.

Some of them are lazy and/or asynchronous, or are just too far removed. Also, some transformations will result in a loss of information. Moving from an Either to a Maybe, for instance, would lose the Left value of Either as a Maybe's first parameter (Nothing) is fixed at Unit. Conversely, if you move the other way around, from a Maybe to an Either you must provide a default Left value. Which means, if the inner Maybe results in a Nothing, it will map to Left of your provided value. As such, not all of these functions are guaranteed isomorphic. With some types you just cannot go back and forth and expect to retain information. Each function provides two signatures, one for if a Function is used for the second argument and another if the source ADT is passed instead. Although it may seem strange, this provides some flexibility on how to apply the transformation. The ADT version is great for squishing an already nested type or to perform the transformation in a composition. While the Function version can be used to extend an existing function without having to explicitly compose it.

These are great when you need to combine a list of values down to one value. In this library, any ADT that provides both an empty and concat function can be used as a Monoid. There are a few of the crocks that are also monoidial, so be on the look out for those as well. All Monoids work with the point-free functions mconcat, mreduce, mconcatMap and mreduceMap. All Monoids provide empty and type function on their Constructors as well as the following Instance Functions: inspect, type, valueOf, empty and concat. | Monoid | Type | Operation | Empty (Identity) | |---|---|---|---| | All | Boolean | Logical AND | true | | Any | Boolean | Logical OR | false | | Assign | Object | Object.assign | {lb}{rb} | | Endo | Function | compose | identity | | First | Maybe | First Just | Nothing | | Last | Maybe | Last Just | Nothing | | Max | Number | Math.max | -Infinity | | Min | Number | Math.min | Infinity | | Prod | Number | Multiplication | 1 | | Sum | Number | Addition | 0 | ","srcFilePath":"src/pages/docs/monoids/index.md","id":"monoids","location":"/docs/monoids/","url":"/crocks/docs/monoids/","childIds":["All","Any"]}},"title":"Documentation","description":"Everything you need to know to get started.","content":" Docs Start learning how to leverage the power of .
